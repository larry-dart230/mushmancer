    The Mushmancer is a peculiar creature that prefers to feast on mushrooms rather than humans. It has a large, round body and curious eyes. It loves to explore dark forests and caves, searching for its favorite food: mushrooms! Its long, sticky tongue is able to reach far into the nooks and crannies of trees and rocks to find the best fungi. Although it might look intimidating with its sharp claws, teeth, and little hair atop its head, the Mushmushmancer is actually quite gentle and harmless.
